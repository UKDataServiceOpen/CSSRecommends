Recommendations from the Computational Social Science team at UK Data Service

## I want to ask for recommendations
Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/UKDataServiceOpen/CSSRecommends/issues) and create a new issue for your recommendations. Make sure you read the below section or check your prompt isn't currently in issues. Most of these resources will be collated in response to questions from the UK Data Service Data Drop-ins.

## Recommendations
### Data Environments
Learning Python or R is an undertaking, you need more than just these languages to work with data. There are a wealth of community packages that make sentiment analysis, entity-matching and more accessible. Package management isn't easy.

* [Day 1 setup](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-environment-for-data-d03c6767efe2) - [Joe](https://twitter.com/JosephAllen1234) summarises his Day 1 setup at the [UKDS](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), covering Python and R with Anaconda.
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) -  is great if your work is notebook based (a collection of data cells and markdown cells explaining your work). You don't need to maintain any environments here, but you will have to remake them for each project.
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - PyCharm is a developer environment specifically for Python users.


### Network Analysis
Network Analysis involves reducing real-world situations to graph views. Generally, the advice was to learn R or Python for more mature network analysis tooling.
* [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/) - A great graphing tool with a detailed quick start section.
* [GraphiPu](https://pypi.org/project/GraphiPy/) - For a Gephi Python libarary, and more, check out the docs for GraphiPy.
* [Social Networking Code Demo 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jcwc9fApnI) - [Diarmuid](https://twitter.com/DiarmuidMc) recently ran a series of interactive coding sessions on Social Networking.
* [Social Networking Code Demo 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1oJiBo14u0) - Part 2 of [Diarmuids](https://twitter.com/DiarmuidMc) Social Networking sessions.

### Geographic plots in R
Nice visualizations of a local area in response to a new dataset is a great way to visualize a story. Telling a good story with data is key to getting more buy-in, resources, data access an more!

* [Crime data in R](https://t.co/5cYy3gHBJP?amp=1) - the UKDS is running a multi-day event covering these visualizations. Recording will be availible shortly!
* [ggplot2](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/327-chloropleth-map-from-geojson-with-ggplot2.html) - A mature R library covering most data viz needs. The link is a quick intro to chloropleth maps.
* [Visualize London boundaries with ggplot2](https://datatricks.co.uk/london-map-in-3-easy-steps) - A tutorial on visualizing London boundaries.
* [Boundary data tool](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/bds.html) - The UKDS maintains a Boundary Data Selector, if this doesn't bring up what you are looking for usually googling something like "London GIS boundaries" will do.
